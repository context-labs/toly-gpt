The `getstarted` folder in the Solana documentation contains resources and guides to help new developers understand and start working with the Solana blockchain. It provides an overview of the Solana ecosystem, its architecture, and the tools available for developers to build and deploy applications on the Solana network.

### Files

1. **`index.md`**: This file serves as the main entry point for the "Getting Started" section of the Solana documentation. It provides an introduction to Solana, its key features, and the benefits of using Solana for building decentralized applications. It also contains links to other sections of the documentation, such as the installation guide, tutorials, and API references.

2. **`installation.md`**: This file contains instructions on how to install the Solana command-line tools, which are required for developers to interact with the Solana network, deploy smart contracts, and manage accounts. It covers installation steps for various operating systems, such as macOS, Linux, and Windows.

3. **`firsttransaction.md`**: This file provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and sign a transaction on the Solana network. It explains the process of creating a new Solana account, funding it with SOL tokens, and sending a transaction to another account. This guide helps developers understand the basics of working with Solana transactions and accounts.

4. **`programming-model.md`**: This file provides an overview of the Solana programming model, which is based on the concept of "accounts" and "instructions". It explains how developers can create and deploy smart contracts (also known as "programs") on the Solana network, and how these programs can interact with accounts to store and manipulate data. It also introduces the concept of "cross-program invocations", which allows programs to call other programs on the network.

5. **`developing.md`**: This file contains a collection of resources and guides for developers who want to build applications on the Solana network. It covers topics such as setting up a development environment, using the Solana command-line tools, writing smart contracts in Rust, and deploying programs to the network. It also provides links to sample code, tutorials, and other resources to help developers get started with Solana development.

### Subfolders

There are no subfolders in the `getstarted` folder.

The `getstarted` folder is an essential resource for developers who are new to the Solana ecosystem. By following the guides and tutorials provided in this folder, developers can quickly learn the basics of Solana, set up their development environment, and start building and deploying applications on the Solana network. For example, a developer might use the installation guide to set up the Solana command-line tools, then follow the first transaction guide to create and sign a transaction, and finally explore the programming model and development resources to build their own smart contracts and applications.
