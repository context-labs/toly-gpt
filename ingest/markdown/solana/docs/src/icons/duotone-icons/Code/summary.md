The `Code` folder in the `duotone-icons` directory contains the SVG files for various code-related icons. These icons are designed in a duotone style, which means they use two colors to create a visually appealing and modern look. These icons are used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user interface and provide a consistent visual language for developers and users.

Here's a summary of the files in this folder:

1. `CodeBranch.svg`: An icon representing a code branch, typically used to indicate branching in version control systems like Git.
2. `CodeCommit.svg`: An icon representing a code commit, typically used to indicate committing changes to a version control system.
3. `CodeDiff.svg`: An icon representing a code diff, typically used to indicate differences between two sets of code.
4. `CodeFork.svg`: An icon representing a code fork, typically used to indicate a fork in a repository or project.
5. `CodeMerge.svg`: An icon representing a code merge, typically used to indicate merging changes from one branch to another in a version control system.
6. `CodePullRequest.svg`: An icon representing a pull request, typically used to indicate a request to merge changes from one branch to another in a version control system.

These icons can be used in various parts of the Solana project, such as in the documentation, user interfaces, or even in the code editor. For example, the `CodeBranch.svg` icon can be used to visually represent branches in a Git repository, while the `CodeCommit.svg` icon can be used to represent individual commits.

To use these icons in your project, you can simply import the SVG files and include them in your HTML or JSX code. Here's an example of how to use the `CodeBranch.svg` icon in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CodeBranchIcon from './icons/duotone-icons/Code/CodeBranch.svg';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Git Branches</h1>
      <img src={CodeBranchIcon} alt="Code Branch Icon" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In summary, the `Code` folder in the `duotone-icons` directory contains a collection of code-related icons in a duotone style. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to provide a consistent visual language and enhance the user experience.
