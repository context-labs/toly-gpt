The `Communication` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG files representing various communication-related icons. These icons are designed with a duotone style, meaning they use two colors to create a visually appealing and easily recognizable representation of the concept they depict. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

Here is a list of the files in this folder and a summary of the contents of each file:

1. `chat.svg`: An icon representing a chat or conversation, typically used to indicate a messaging or communication feature.
2. `email.svg`: An icon representing an email or envelope, commonly used to signify email-related functionality or notifications.
3. `phone.svg`: An icon representing a telephone, often used to indicate phone call or contact-related features.
4. `video-call.svg`: An icon representing a video call or conference, typically used to signify video communication or collaboration tools.

These icons can be easily integrated into various parts of the Solana project, such as in buttons, menus, or notifications. For example, the `chat.svg` icon can be used in a button that opens a messaging interface, while the `email.svg` icon can be used to indicate the presence of unread emails in a user's inbox.

To use these icons in your project, you can simply import the SVG files and include them in your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code. Here's an example of how to use the `chat.svg` icon in an HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button>
        <img src="path/to/Communication/chat.svg" alt="Chat Icon" />
        Open Chat
    </button>
</body>
</html>
```

In summary, the `Communication` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory provides a set of communication-related icons that can be used to enhance the user interface of the Solana project. These icons are designed with a duotone style, making them visually appealing and easily recognizable. By incorporating these icons into various parts of the project, developers can improve the overall user experience and make the platform more intuitive and user-friendly.
