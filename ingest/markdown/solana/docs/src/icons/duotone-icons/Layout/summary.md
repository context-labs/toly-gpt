The `Layout` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG icons specifically designed for the Solana project. These icons are created using a duotone style, which means they consist of two colors or shades. This design choice allows for a consistent and visually appealing user interface throughout the project.

The icons in this folder are related to layout and design elements, such as grids, containers, and alignment. They can be used in various parts of the Solana project to enhance the user experience and provide a clear visual representation of different layout options and functionalities.

Here's a brief overview of the files in the `Layout` folder:

1. `align-center.svg`: An icon representing the center alignment of elements within a container.
2. `align-left.svg`: An icon representing the left alignment of elements within a container.
3. `align-right.svg`: An icon representing the right alignment of elements within a container.
4. `container.svg`: An icon representing a container element, which can hold and organize other elements.
5. `grid.svg`: An icon representing a grid layout, where elements are organized in rows and columns.

These icons can be used in various parts of the Solana project, such as in the user interface of a wallet application, a block explorer, or a dashboard. They can help users understand the layout options available to them and make it easier to navigate and interact with the application.

For example, a developer might use the `align-left.svg` icon in a toolbar to allow users to align text or other elements to the left within a container. The code for implementing this icon might look like this:

```html
<button class="toolbar-button" title="Align Left">
  <img src="icons/duotone-icons/Layout/align-left.svg" alt="Align Left" />
</button>
```

Similarly, the `grid.svg` icon could be used in a settings panel to allow users to switch between different layout modes, such as a grid view or a list view. The code for implementing this icon might look like this:

```html
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="layout-mode" value="grid" />
  <img src="icons/duotone-icons/Layout/grid.svg" alt="Grid View" />
  Grid View
</label>
```

In summary, the `Layout` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG icons related to layout and design elements. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user experience and provide a clear visual representation of different layout options and functionalities.
