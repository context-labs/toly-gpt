Example usage:

```rust
use solana_runtime::bank::Bank;

// Create a new bank
let bank = Bank::new(&genesis_block);

// Process a transaction
let tx = Transaction::new_with_payer(&instructions, Some(&payer_pubkey));
let result = bank.process_transaction(&tx);
assert_eq!(result, Ok(()));

// Get the balance of an account
let account_balance = bank.get_balance(&account_pubkey);
println!("Account balance: {}", account_balance);
```
## Questions:
