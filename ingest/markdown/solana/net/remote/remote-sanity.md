The `remote-sanity.sh` script is used to perform sanity checks on a Solana network. The script is intended to be run on the bootstrap validator node. The script takes an IP address as an argument, which is the target node to perform the sanity checks on. The script reads the `deployConfig` file, which is generated by the `remote-node.sh` script, to obtain the deployment configuration for the network.

The script performs several checks on the target node, including checking the number of validators, the number of nodes, and the RPC API. The script also checks the wallet sanity if airdrops are enabled. If the `installCheck` flag is set to true, the script performs a `solana-install` test on the target node.

The script takes several options, including `noInstallCheck` to skip the `solana-install` test, and `rejectExtraNodes` to reject extra nodes if the `failOnValidatorBootupFailure` flag is set to true.

The script sources the `net/common.sh` file and loads the configuration file using the `loadConfigFile` function. The script uses the `solana`, `solana-gossip`, and `solana-install` binaries to perform the checks.

The `remote-sanity.sh` script is used to ensure that the Solana network is functioning correctly. The script is part of the Solana project and is used to perform sanity checks on the network. The script can be used to diagnose issues with the network and ensure that the network is operating as expected. 

Example usage:

```
./remote-sanity.sh 192.168.1.1 -o noInstallCheck
```

This will perform sanity checks on the node with IP address `192.168.1.1` and skip the `solana-install` test.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to run sanity checks on a Solana network validator node.

2. What are the inputs required to run this script?
   
   The script requires the IP address of the validator node to run the sanity checks on, as well as a `deployConfig` file that contains configuration information for the network.

3. What are some of the sanity checks that are performed by this script?
   
   This script performs several sanity checks, including checking the number of nodes on the network, checking the RPC API for the `getTransactionCount` method, and running a wallet sanity check (if airdrops are enabled).
