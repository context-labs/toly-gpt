The `output/clockwork/audits` folder is part of the larger Clockwork project and contains files and subfolders related to auditing various aspects of the system. Auditing is an essential process in software development, as it helps to ensure the quality, security, and performance of the codebase. In the context of the Clockwork project, the `audits` folder is responsible for storing the results of these audits, which can be used by developers to identify and fix potential issues.

Here is a summary of the files and subfolders in the `output/clockwork/audits` folder:

### Files:

1. `audit_summary.txt`: This file contains a high-level summary of the audit results, including the total number of issues found, the severity of each issue, and any recommendations for resolving them. Developers can refer to this file to get a quick overview of the current state of the codebase and prioritize their efforts accordingly.

2. `audit_details.csv`: This file provides a more detailed breakdown of the audit results, listing each issue found along with its location in the codebase, a description of the problem, and any suggested fixes. Developers can use this file to drill down into specific issues and understand their root causes.

3. `audit_log.log`: This file contains a chronological log of all audit-related activities, such as when an audit was run, who initiated it, and any changes made to the codebase as a result. This log can be useful for tracking the progress of audit-related tasks and ensuring that all issues are being addressed in a timely manner.

### Subfolders:

1. `performance`: This subfolder contains files and data related to performance audits, which are focused on identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks in the codebase. This may include profiling data, performance test results, and any scripts or tools used to analyze and improve the system's performance.

2. `security`: This subfolder is dedicated to security audits, which aim to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the codebase. It may contain vulnerability reports, security test results, and any tools or scripts used to assess and improve the system's security posture.

3. `code_quality`: This subfolder houses files and data related to code quality audits, which focus on ensuring that the codebase adheres to best practices and coding standards. This may include code review reports, static analysis results, and any tools or scripts used to enforce and improve code quality.

In summary, the `output/clockwork/audits` folder plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and quality of the Clockwork project. By storing and organizing audit results, it enables developers to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise during the development process. This, in turn, helps to ensure that the final product is secure, performant, and adheres to industry best practices.
